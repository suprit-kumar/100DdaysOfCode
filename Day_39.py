# If ... Else in One Line

"""
There is also a shorthand syntax for the if-else statement that can be used
when the condition being tested is simple and
the code blocks to be executed are short. Here's an example:
"""

a = 330000
b = 3303
print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")

c = 9 if a>b else 0
print(c)
