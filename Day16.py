# Match case statements
# Works only above python 3.10 and above
# To implement switch-case like characteristics very similar to if-else functionality, we use a match case in python.
# A match statement will compare a given variableâ€™s value to different shapes, also referred to as the pattern. The main idea is to keep on comparing the variable with all the present patterns until it fits into one.


x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))
# x is the variable to match
match x:
    # if x is 0
    case 0:
        print("x is zero")
    # case with if-condition
    case 4:
        print("case is 4")
    case _ if x != 90:
        print(x, "is not 90")
    case _:  # _ is default match
        print(x, "is not 80")
